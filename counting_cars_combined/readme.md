To update my Shiny app to work with data from multiple students instead of just my own, I modified the code to read in multiple .xlsx files directly. Each student had collected slightly different information, with inconsistent column names and formats, so I had to clean and standardize all the datasets in R. I wrote code to rename columns, handle missing values, and ensure that all datasets contained the key fields: Initial_Speed, Final_Speed, Speed_Change, and Vehicle_Type.

One of the biggest challenges was dealing with how differently everyone recorded their data. Some datasets only had one speed value, others labeled cars by brand instead of type, and a few used numeric codes for vehicles. I had to manually map these differences and transform everything into a consistent structure before I could combine them. After cleaning, I also had to update the Shiny app logic, especially in the plots grouped by vehicle typeâ€”to avoid showing duplicate or incorrect categories.
